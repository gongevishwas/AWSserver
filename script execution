Step-by-step shell script execution
Create a directory to store your shell script
Create a file in your scripts folder with a .sh extension
Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution
Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window
Press CTRL+C to stop the running Linux script if it does not terminate gracefully

$ mkdir scripts
$ cd scripts
$ touch script.sh
$ echo 'echo hello-world' >> script.sh
$ chmod -R 777 .
$ ./script.sh
hello-world
